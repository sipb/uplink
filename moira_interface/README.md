# Moira Matrix integration

This is a Matrix bot that integrates with MIT mailing lists

You need a config file with the following contents:

```json
{
    "homeserver": "https://uplink.mit.edu",
    "username": "@moira-bot:uplink.mit.edu",
    "token": "your-precious-token-goes-here"
}
```

TODO: would be good to use `poetry` or something else for dependency management
